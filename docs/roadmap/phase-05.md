## Phase 5: Agent SDK Migration ✅

**Goal**: Replace the `claude -p` shell invocation layer with the Claude Agent
SDK (`claude-agent-sdk`), running inside the existing Docker container. The Go
CLI and container isolation are preserved; the SDK runs as a small Python script
inside the container image.

**Milestone**: `Phase 5` | **Label**: `phase-5`

### Invocation layer rewrite
- Add `agent_runner.py` to the Docker image — a thin SDK wrapper that reads
  the prompt from `$GODARK_PROMPT`, calls `query()`, and streams structured
  output to stdout
- Update `launcher.go` (`runSandbox`) to invoke the Python runner instead of
  building a shell entrypoint around `claude -p`
- Update `dockerfile.go` to install Python + `claude-agent-sdk` (replace
  Claude Code CLI install)

### Role-scoped permissions
- Implementer: `allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]`
- Reviewer: `allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Bash"]`,
  `disallowed_tools=["Write", "Edit"]` — reviewer literally cannot modify files
- Spec generator: `allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Glob", "Grep"]` — no Bash

### Preventive guardrails via hooks
- `PreToolUse` hook on `Write|Edit` to deny modifications to protected paths
  (currently detected post-hoc by `CheckProtectedDrift`)
- Agent receives a `systemMessage` explaining why the write was blocked, so it
  can adjust rather than failing silently
- `PostToolUse` audit hook logging every tool call for structured telemetry

### Session resumption for retries
- Capture `session_id` from implementer's first run
- On `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, resume the implementer session with reviewer feedback
  instead of cold-starting a new agent invocation
- Eliminates context re-discovery on retries — agent remembers its reasoning,
  which files it changed, and why

### Structured output parsing
- Replace `REVIEW_RESULT=` sentinel grepping with typed SDK message parsing
- Capture implementer's tool-use trace and pass to reviewer for richer review
  context (reviewer sees what the agent explored, not just the final diff)

### Cleanup
- Delete `GenerateClaudeConfig()` from `auth.go` (SDK has no onboarding dialogs)
- Remove `ClaudeFlags` from config and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from auth
- Simplify `auth.go` `CollectAuthEnv()` (SDK handles API key natively;
  only `GH_TOKEN` still needs forwarding)

**Issues**: #36–#41
