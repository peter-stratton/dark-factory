## Phase 4: Agent Execution ✅

**Goal**: `godark run --milestone "M" --repo owner/repo` autonomously implements,
reviews, and merges GitHub issues using Claude Code agents inside Docker
containers. This is the first phase whose issues are vetted by `godark vet`
before implementation begins.

**Milestone**: `Phase 4` | **Label**: `phase-4`

### Agent launcher
- Invoke `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` with prompt templates
- Load prompt templates from config-specified file paths
- Capture agent stdout/stderr for log parsing
- Execute agents inside Docker sandbox (from Phase 3)

### Implementer agent (Agent 1)
- **Fresh mode**: create feature branch, implement issue, write unit tests, open PR
- **Retry mode**: check out existing PR, read review comments, fix issues, push

### Reviewer agent (Agent 2)
- Check out PR, read matching scenario specs
- Generate ephemeral integration tests in `tests/review/`
- Run all tests, approve or request changes
- Clean up `tests/review/` before finishing
- Output `REVIEW_RESULT=APPROVED` or `REVIEW_RESULT=CHANGES_REQUESTED`

### Guard rails (script-level, not prompt-level)
- PR existence check after implementer finishes
- `Closes #N` auto-append if missing from PR body
- Protected path drift detection (reject PRs touching protected files)
- Scenario spec presence warning (comment on PR if no spec exists)
- `REVIEW_RESULT` sentinel parsing from reviewer output
- golangci-lint as additional quality gate (configurable lint command in `godark.yaml`)

### Orchestration
- Review/retry loop (max N retries from config)
- Merge approved PRs (squash + delete branch) or escalate (label `needs-human-review`)
- Baseline commit recording before each issue for rollback reference
- `git pull --rebase origin main` after each merge
- Single-issue mode (`--issue N`)
- `godark implement <issue-number>` — direct single-issue command (no milestone/deps)
- Summary stats at end (implemented, skipped, failed)

**Issues**: #29 (closed); remaining work completed without formal issue tracking
