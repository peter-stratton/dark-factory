## Phase 3: Docker Sandbox ✅

**Goal**: Run agents in isolated containers for safety. The user's working
directory is never touched — all agent work happens in a container. Required
before agent execution so that `--dangerously-skip-permissions` runs in a
confined environment.

**Milestone**: `Phase 3` | **Label**: `phase-3`

- Dockerfile generation and image management
- Container lifecycle: build image, run agent, capture output, cleanup
- Auth forwarding: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- Pre-configured `.claude.json` for headless operation (skip onboarding, trust dialogs)
- Non-root user (Claude Code refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as root)
- Repo cloning or worktree inside container (not host volume mount)
- `--no-sandbox` flag to run agents directly on the host

**Issues**: #20–#24 (all closed)
