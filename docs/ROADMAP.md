# Dark Factory — Roadmap

> A Go CLI that orchestrates autonomous AI agents to implement GitHub issues,
> review their own work, and merge — without human intervention.

---

## Phase 1: Skeleton + Orchestration ✅

**Goal**: `godark run --milestone "Phase 1" --repo owner/repo --dry-run` works
end-to-end. Fetches issues, resolves dependencies, sorts by priority, and
prints the execution plan. No agent execution in this phase.

**Milestone**: `Phase 1` | **Label**: `phase-1`

- Project scaffold and CLI skeleton (Cobra, subcommand stubs)
- YAML config parsing with CLI flag overrides
- GitHub issue fetching with priority sorting (p1 → p2 → p3 → unlabeled)
- Dependency resolution from issue bodies (`Blocked by`, `Depends on`)
- Structured logging (JSON file + human-readable stdout)
- Orchestration loop with dry-run mode
- CLAUDE.md and scenario specs for Phase 2 validation

**Issues**: #1–#7 (all closed)

---

## Phase 2: Quality & Vetting

**Goal**: The `godark vet` subcommand validates that roadmap docs and GitHub
issues are clear, unambiguous, and fully actionable by agents. Built early so
it can be used to validate issues for all subsequent phases.

**Milestone**: `Phase 2` | **Label**: `phase-2`

- Vet command scaffold and validation framework (Finding types, report format)
- Issue structure validation (`godark vet issues`)
- Scenario spec validation (`godark vet scenarios`)
- Roadmap validation (`godark vet roadmap`)

**Issues**: #14–#17

## Phase 3: Docker Sandbox

**Goal**: Run agents in isolated containers for safety. The user's working
directory is never touched — all agent work happens in a container. Required
before agent execution so that `--dangerously-skip-permissions` runs in a
confined environment.

**Milestone**: `Phase 3` | **Label**: `phase-3`

- Dockerfile generation and image management
- Container lifecycle: build image, run agent, capture output, cleanup
- Auth forwarding: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- Pre-configured `.claude.json` for headless operation (skip onboarding, trust dialogs)
- Non-root user (Claude Code refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as root)
- Repo cloning or worktree inside container (not host volume mount)
- `--no-sandbox` flag to run agents directly on the host

---

## Phase 4: Agent Execution

**Goal**: `godark run --milestone "M" --repo owner/repo` autonomously implements,
reviews, and merges GitHub issues using Claude Code agents inside Docker
containers. This is the first phase whose issues are vetted by `godark vet`
before implementation begins.

**Milestone**: `Phase 4` | **Label**: `phase-4`

### Agent launcher
- Invoke `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` with prompt templates
- Load prompt templates from config-specified file paths
- Capture agent stdout/stderr for log parsing
- Execute agents inside Docker sandbox (from Phase 3)

### Implementer agent (Agent 1)
- **Fresh mode**: create feature branch, implement issue, write unit tests, open PR
- **Retry mode**: check out existing PR, read review comments, fix issues, push

### Reviewer agent (Agent 2)
- Check out PR, read matching scenario specs
- Generate ephemeral integration tests in `tests/review/`
- Run all tests, approve or request changes
- Clean up `tests/review/` before finishing
- Output `REVIEW_RESULT=APPROVED` or `REVIEW_RESULT=CHANGES_REQUESTED`

### Guard rails (script-level, not prompt-level)
- PR existence check after implementer finishes
- `Closes #N` auto-append if missing from PR body
- Protected path drift detection (reject PRs touching protected files)
- Scenario spec presence warning (comment on PR if no spec exists)
- `REVIEW_RESULT` sentinel parsing from reviewer output
- golangci-lint as additional quality gate (configurable lint command in `godark.yaml`)

### Orchestration
- Review/retry loop (max N retries from config)
- Merge approved PRs (squash + delete branch) or escalate (label `needs-human-review`)
- Baseline commit recording before each issue for rollback reference
- `git pull --rebase origin main` after each merge
- Single-issue mode (`--issue N`)
- Summary stats at end (implemented, skipped, failed)

---

## Phase 5: Run Review Dashboard

**Goal**: `godark status` serves a local web UI for reviewing dev-loop runs,
making it easy for humans to spot-check agent work.

**Milestone**: `Phase 5` | **Label**: `phase-5`

- Local web server serving a review dashboard
- Homepage: list of dev-loop runs with summary stats (issues processed, pass/fail counts)
- Run detail view: per-issue outcomes (implemented, skipped, failed, retry count)
- GitHub diff links for each PR (easy human spot-checking)
- Manual test punchlist generation at end of each dev-loop run
- Log viewer (parsed JSON structured logs with filtering)
